                A generic class that is used to set up specs for an elasticity
                strategy.


                A concrete `ElasticityStrategy` may use
                `ElasticityStrategySpec<T>` directly as the type for its spec,
                or a class derived from this one, if, e.g., the transformation
                needs to be customized.


                Parameters that are defined by the output of the SLO are stored
                in `sloOutputParams`. The type of this property determines if an
                elasticity strategy is compatible with a certain SLO.


                `staticConfig` should be used for other configuration data,
                which is not changed by the SLO.

                        Specifies how much the current state of the system
                        complies with the SLO.


                        This value must be specified as an integer, e.g., `50`
                        meaning 50%, `100` meaning 100%, `200` meaning 200%.


                        If this value is `100`, the SLO is met exactly and no
                        scaling action is required.


                        If this value is greater than `100`, the SLO is violated
                        and scaling out/up is required.


                        If this value is less than `100`, the system is
                        performing better than the SLO demands and scaling
                        in/down will be performed.

                        scaling will be performed.


                        For example, if tolerance is `10`, no scaling will be
                        performed as long as `currSloCompliancePercentage` is
                        between `90` and `110`.

                  description: >-
                    StabilizationWindow allows configuring the period of time
                    that an elasticity strategy controller will wait after
                    applying the strategy once, before applying it again (if the
                    SLO is still violated), to avoid unnecessary scaling.


                    For example, suppose that ScaleUpSeconds = 180 and a
                    horizontal elasticity strategy scales out at time `t` due to
                    an SLO violation. At time `t + 20 seconds` the SLO's
                    evaluation still results in a violation, but the elasticity
                    strategy does not scale again, because the stabilization
                    window for scaling up/out has not yet passed. If the SLO
                    evaluation at `t + 200 seconds` still results in a
                    violation, the controller will scale again.
