                    Limited alternative for `Omit<T, K>` that provides a
                    workaround for an issue with ts-json-schema-generator.


                    While ts-json-schema-generator can handle `Omit<SomeType,
                    K>`, it throws the following error when `SomeType` is itself
                    a generic parameter: ``` LogicError: Unexpected key type
                    "undefined" for type "{     [P in K]: T[P]; }" (expected
                    "UnionType" or "StringType") ```


                    `CrdOmit` does not remove the properties from `T` like
                    `Omit` would, but it's workaround that works with
                    ts-json-schema-generator.
