                    StabilizationWindow allows configuring the period of time
                    that an elasticity strategy controller will wait after
                    applying the strategy once, before applying it again (if the
                    SLO is still violated), to avoid unnecessary scaling.


                    For example, suppose that ScaleUpSeconds = 180 and a
                    horizontal elasticity strategy scales out at time `t` due to
                    an SLO violation. At time `t + 20 seconds` the SLO's
                    evaluation still results in a violation, but the elasticity
                    strategy does not scale again, because the stabilization
                    window for scaling up/out has not yet passed. If the SLO
                    evaluation at `t + 200 seconds` still results in a
                    violation, the controller will scale again.

                    For example, suppose the SLO knows only about the parameters
                    in `SloCompliance`, but you want to use an elasticity
                    strategy that requires an additional parameter, e.g.,
                    `maxReplicas`. This can be configured when instantiating the
                    SloMapping:


                    ``` new MySloMapping({      elasticityStrategy: new
                    ElasticityStrategyKind({          kind:

                    spec.          maxReplicas: 100,      }, }); ```
